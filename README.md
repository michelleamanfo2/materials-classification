# materials-classification
Research project on classifying materials using Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We compared models such as KNN, CNN, and Decision Trees, applying feature extraction, training, and evaluation to demonstrate deep learningâ€™s role in material recognition for science and engineering.
